## Abstract 
Cancer is a widespread disease in modern world. 
Prostate cancer is a cancer type which affects only men and the onset happens around the age of 65 in majority of the cases. 
This disease accompanies a wide array of symptoms which are often not reported routinely due to multitude of reasons. 
Studies have found that routine reporting of symptoms leads to several clinical benefits in terms of combating the disease progression. 
Procare is a solution aimed at connecting the patient with the doctor digitally in order to enable the doctor to more easily keep track of the disease progression in the patient and take preventive measures to prolong the patients life expectancy. 
It is a digital ecosystem which offers facilities of symptom reporting, medication tracking, a knowledge network, and a chat feature for the patient to talk with the doctor. 
A patient can interact with the ecosystem easily using the web/mobile interface or smart devices such as Amazon Alexa or Amazon IoT Button.
